# TROOP QA Automation Challenge 2024

Welcome to the TROOP QA Automation Challenge. This exercise is designed to assess your skills in automated testing using Playwright and your proficiency with Git for version control.

## Project Overview

In this challenge, you will be automating test cases for specific functionalities on ["The Internet" by Heroku](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com), a web application designed for testing. Your tasks will involve writing scripts using Playwright, preferably with TypeScript, and managing your code using Git.

## Setup

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. This creates your personal copy for the challenge.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Login Functionality Test

The development team has made changes to the way the login is done on the "The Internet". Please develop test cases to ensure the correct functioning of this page in all possible cases.

- Automate test cases for the "Form Authentication" section on "The Internet".
- Validate and log the results of these attempts.

### Task 2: Dynamic Content Handling

The development team has made some improvements to the API's, we need to ensure the pages are still working as they did before - Please develop cases to ensure correct functioning of both example pages for all possible cases.

- Write a script/scripts to interact with the "Dynamic Loading" section of "The Internet".
- Validate and log the results of these attempts.


### Task 3: Dropdown Interaction

There are some items added and removed to the dropdown - develop cases that ensure the dropdowns are functioning correctly in all possible cases

- Automate interactions with a dropdown menu in the "Dropdown" section of "The Internet".
- Validate and log the results of these attempts.

## Submission

Once you have completed all the tasks, ensure all your changes are pushed to your forked repository. Create a pull request to merge back into the main branch - send a mail to daniel@trooptravel.com for review and inform him that you have completed the exercise.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The correctness and efficiency of your Playwright scripts, ideally written in TypeScript, although other languages are acceptable.
- Code quality, organization, and adherence to coding best practices. Ensure documentation is available
- Effective use of Git within your forked repository.

## Rules and Guidelines

- Your forked repository is your private workspace. Do not share or copy work from others.
- Ensure your work is done independently and adheres to the highest standards of integrity.

We wish you the best of luck and are excited to see your innovative solutions!

Best Regards,
